				<h1>Long-Distance Love</h1>
			</header>

			<p>My Darling, there are countless words I wish to write down to tell you how much I love you. Even though we may be separated, forbidden the warmth of a physical embrace, know that you are on my mind always. All of my goals and actions are with you at the forefront to keep my longing at bay. I may not be able to see your beautiful smile in person, but the memory of it drives me to new heights day by day.</p>

			<p>I am thankful that we can at least talk every day through a Unix shell. Every new project that I start fills me with joy knowing that whenever I set up a new remote with “git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git”, we will soon see each other, even if it is only momentarily. As soon as I push all of my committed files with “git push -u origin &lt;branch name&lg;” my heart skips a beat with the anticipation that you will receive all of my work so far. It’s a bit silly to need to enter a username and password, don’t you think? Though we have only started this relationship recently, we know each other by heart.</p>

			<p>I know it’s selfish to say, but I would much rather be able to work with you and only you alone. The time we have to each other is never enough to sate my desire for you.I see new changes that others make whenever I use “git fetch” and there are conflicts or files added. Or when I have to use “git clone &lt;repository&lg;”, I see so much activity in these other projects. I get a bit jealous with knowing how much time I see you’ve spent with everyone else. Really, I understand that there are others you need to be with on these projects, but is it too much to ask?</p>

			<p>But, as soon as I use “git merge origin/branchname” the time spent catching up with you on all of these new changes are some of the best times I have with you. When I’m ready to begin my work and use “git checkout -b &lt;branchname&lg;” to start the day anew with a new branch and immediately switch to it, it’s so refreshing to have such a carefree environment with just you and me. I would spend all hours of the day with your loving smile if I could. I would relinquish all other commitments in a heartbeat just to spend more time with you. In the end, I know that can’t happen. We both have our own personal commitments. I see it after I’m done adding all of my new work and make my commit message because I always use “git fetch” to see if there are other changes to our repository from other people. There usually is something there and I knew that the moments you had to leave were the same moments others needed to ask you something.</p>

			<p>After a “git push” to add all of my changes to the repository that goodbye kiss lingers on in my mind. I can’t help but long for the next time we get to meet again, even if it is only digitally. I’ll remember that smile as we part. That sweet smile of yours, a spirited wink hinting that we will meet again soon. It’s all I need to keep me going.</p>
